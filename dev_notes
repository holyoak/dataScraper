TODO:  Fixes for current work

* Add {_id: -1, data:'done'} 'end of data' document to datasets that have reached back to genesis
* Add sanity check for 1 min candle data
* Improve normalization script
* End of data collection results in hung process, process should exit
* Logger should report current market (not just timestamp)


TODO:  Scaling concerns

* Create static json lib of exchange[s] props in src/, keep config.json as top level config only
* Sniff dB to see if dataset already exists, if so => sanity check and fill in gaps
* Parallelize multiple exchange requests

ROADMAP: Scope additions

* Create front end for user input
* Data visualizations
    => see http://bl.ocks.org/andredumas/27c4a333b0e0813e093d
* Split into public/minion forks for different use cases
